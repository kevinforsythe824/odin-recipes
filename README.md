This current project will require me to test my html skills by creating an index page and add a few links

The skills I'll have shown by the end of this project is:
    1. How to create an index.html page
    2. Creating an html boilerplate
    3. Using basic html heading values to create a heading
    4. Using link values to link to absolute and relative links
